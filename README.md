## Project Title: 
**Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset**

---

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data by applying various data preprocessing and visualization techniques. Through this task, I aimed to explore key patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the dataset and enhance my understanding of data science techniques.

## Key Activities:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Identified and handled missing values in critical columns like `Age`, `Cabin`, etc.
   - Ensured the data was in a usable format for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Analyzed the distribution of key features like `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `Fare`, and `Sex`.
   - Visualized relationships between numerical and categorical data using various plots.

3. **Visualization Techniques**  
   - Created **count plots** for categorical variables like `Sex` and `Survived`.
   - Used **box plots** to explore fare variations and detect outliers.
   - Generated **scatter plots** to identify patterns between `Age`, `Fare`, and survival.
   - Built **heatmaps** to observe correlations between numerical features.

4. **Outlier Detection**  
   - Applied **box plots** to identify and analyze outliers, particularly in the `Fare` column.

5. **Distribution Analysis**  
   - Used **histograms** to analyze the distribution of passenger ages.

## Technology Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
  - **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and missing values.
  - **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and data visualization.
  - **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations like heatmaps, box plots, and count plots.

## Insights:
1. **Survival Rate Analysis**:  
   - Female passengers and first-class travelers had significantly higher survival rates.

2. **Impact of Fare**:  
   - Higher fares were strongly correlated with higher survival chances, indicating a potential socio-economic impact on survival.

3. **Age Distribution**:  
   - The majority of passengers were aged between 20-30 years.

4. **Embarkation Points**:  
   - Certain embarkation points had a notable effect on survival probabilities, further suggesting socio-economic factors influencing survival.

5. **Outlier Detection**:  
   - Outliers in the `Fare` column were identified, providing deeper insight into atypical passenger cases.

---

## Conclusion:
This project provided valuable hands-on experience with the basic steps of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), helping me apply key techniques to real-world data. It allowed me to sharpen my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and deriving insights from datasets, strengthening my foundation in Data Science.

---

## Future Scope:
- Perform more advanced analyses such as machine learning predictions on survival.
- Explore other features and their relationships with survival, such as `Embarked` and `SibSp`.
- Extend the analysis to the test dataset for a more comprehensive exploration.
